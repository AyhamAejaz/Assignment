        "Syntax Errors: Python relies on indentation to define code blocks such as loops, conditional statements, function definitions, and classes. Incorrect indentation can result in syntax errors, where the interpreter is unable to parse the code due to deviations from the expected indentation level.\n",
        "\n",
        "IndentationError: When the Python interpreter encounters incorrect indentation, it raises an IndentationError. This error indicates that there is a problem with the indentation of the code and provides information about the specific line where the issue occurred.\n",

        "Logical Errors: Even if the code runs without raising syntax errors, incorrect indentation can lead to logical errors. For example, misaligned code blocks may cause statements to be executed in unintended contexts, resulting in unexpected behavior and incorrect program output.\n",
        "\n",
        "Readability Issues: Inconsistent or incorrect indentation makes the code harder to read and understand. It becomes challenging for developers to discern the structure and flow of the program, leading to confusion and reduced code maintainability.\n",
